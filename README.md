Submitted by: **Khristian McPeters**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon API App** is an android app that **Displays a random character from the pokemon API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ‡**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [ ] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [ ] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [ ] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **PokeAPI**.
